<h3>Configured Usernames</h3>

In case you need low-level access to the Virtual Appliance, two usernames have been set up:  <i>root</i> and <i>ewd</i>.<br><br>  

<p>Both have an initial password of <i>1234567</i>.  <i>ewd</i> has sudo privelege.  Both usernames can be used to access the Virtual Appliance via SSH.  
 To access the Virtual Appliance using SSH from a Windows PC, we recommend using 
 <i><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html" target="putty">puTTY</a></i> and 
 <i><a href="http://winscp.net/eng/index.php" target="winscp">WinSCP</a></i>.</p>

<p>
 However, most day-to-day management/ maintenance-related access will be done via the browser interface: just point a browser at the IP address 
that has been assigned to the Virtual Appliance, eg <i>http://192.168.1.21</i></p>

<p>For M/DB REST clients, the M/DB Virtual Appliance appears as a "black-box" equivalent to SimpleDB, accessible via 
the same REST APIs with the exception that the requests are directed at the domain name/IP address assigned to the M/DB 
Virtual Appliance.</p>
