<h3>Shutting down and rebooting the M/DB Virtual Appliance</h3>

If you want to close down the M/DB Virtual Appliance, you should shut down Linux in an orderly fashion.  Do this by typing:<br><br>

<i>sudo shutdown -h now</i><br><br>

(Note: You'll be asked for the root password.  By default this is <i>1234567</i>.  Leave off the "sudo " if you are logged in as root)<br><br>

If you need to reboot the Virtual Appliance for any reason, use:<br><br>

<i>sudo shutdown -r now</i><br><br>

<p>The pre-built startup scripts will ensure that everything is re-initialised and restarted in an orderly fashion</p>
