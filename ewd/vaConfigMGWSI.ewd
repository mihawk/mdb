<h3><i>m_apache</i> Gateway</h3>

The <i>m_apache</i> gateway automatically starts when the M/DB Virtual Appliance is booted up and the Apache Web Server starts.  

<p>
<i>m_apache</i> has been configured such that any URL to the path <i>/mdb</i> and that ends with the file extension <i>.mgwsi</i> 
will automatically invoke the back-end M/DB routine.  See the file <i>/etc/apache2/sites-available/default</i> to examine 
 and/or change this configuration.
</p>


<p>To stop, start or restart <i>m_apache</i>, simply stop, start or restart Apache, eg:</p>

<i>
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart<br>
</i>

<p>Note: if you create and/or edit and recompile an EWD application, page or fragment, there's no need to restart <i>m_apache</i> 
 in order to ensure that the latest version of the compiled GT.M Mumps routines are used by the back-end
 <i>m_apache</i> processes. EWD's run-time engine is automatically notified of changes to your pages and relinks 
 any routines that it is using.  <i>m_apache</i> restarts should therefore be rarely required.</p> 

<p>If you make any changes to pre-page or action scripts, you can force m_apache to relink them automatically by 
 invoking:</p>

<ul>
 <li><i>d relink^%zewdGTM</i></li>
</ul>

<p>For further details regarding <i>m_apache</i> see the documentation that is included in its source file 
<i>/usr/mgwsi/bin/m_apache.c</i>.</p>
