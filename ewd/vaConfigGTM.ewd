<h3>Managing the GT.M MUMPS Environment</h3>
</a>
A fully working GT.M system has been included in this Appliance. It is used as the core 
 DBMS technology in which M/DB domains and their contents are stored and maintained.  
 GT.M has been pre-configured for you as follows:<br><br>


<table border=1>
 <tr>
  <td>GT.M installation directory</td>
  <td>/usr/local/gtm/</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>M/DB installation and GT.M working directory</td>
  <td>/usr/local/gtm/ewd</td>
 </tr>
</table>
<br>

Note: If you are using the M/DB Appliance within an Amazon EC2 AMI instance and you 
 have configured an EBS volume using the M/DB installer script, you should access GT.M 
 in the following directory:<br><br>

<table border=1>
 <tr>
  <td>GT.M installation directory</td>
  <td>/usr/local/gtm</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>M/DB installation and GT.M working directory</td>
  <td>/mdb/ewd</td>
 </tr>
</table>
<br>

The GT.M profile has been automatically set up for you.  If you want to get into the 
 GT.M MUMPS environment shell, do the following:<br><br>

<i>
cd /usr/local/gtm/ewd<br>
$gtm<br>
GTM>
</i>
<br><br>

If you are running the M/DB Appliance in an EC2 instance with an EBS volume, access the 
 GT.M environment as follows:<br><br>

<i>
cd /mdb/ewd<br>
$gtm<br>
GTM>
</i>
<br><br>

To logout and return to the Linux shell prompt:<br><br>

<i>
GTM>H<br>
ewd@ubuntuJEOS:/usr/local/gtm/ewd$<br>
</i>
<br>


<p>All M/DB domains and their contents are stored within GT.M as a single Mumps global named ^MDB.  
You can use the standard GT.M administrative tools for backup, restore, 
archiving etc of this global.</p>

<p>For further information about GT.M, go to <a href="http://www.fis-gtm.com">http://www.fis-gtm.com</a> and download the documentation. 
However, for convenience,a copy of the main GT.M documents are included within this M/DB Appliance.  Just click 
the Documentation tab above.</p>

<hr>
Note: If you build your own Ubuntu JEOS or LAMP Server-based M/DB system, you must open up the privileges to the <i>/var</i> path in order to get GT.M working, ie do the following:<br><br>
<i>
cd /<br>
sudo chmod 777 var
</i>
