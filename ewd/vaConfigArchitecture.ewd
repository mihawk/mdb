<h3>M/DB Appliance Architecture</h3>

The M/DB installer that you used to create this Appliance installed and configured 
 the following components:

<ul>
<li>Apache 2</li>
<li>OpenSSH : SSH Server</li>
<li>GT.M database engine</li>
<li>The Free Open Source <i>m_apache</i> gateway (connects Apache to GT.M)</li>
<li>M/DB (Free Open Source)</li>
<li>Free Open Source version of Enterprise Web Developer</li>
</ul>


You therefore have a fully functioning, fully configured M/DB database environment that 
should work for most people "out of the box".<br><br>

You can, of course, construct your own custom Linux system using the same components.  
This pre-built Appliance and these notes should provide all the background details 
you'll need to build your own equivalent system.<br><br>

The architecture of your M/DB Appliance is shown diagrammatically below:<br><br>

<br><br>

You can adapt and modify the setup and configuration of the M/DB Appliance if you 
wish.  The following notes should provide you with most of the information you need to 
customise and tune your M/DB Appliance.<br><br>
