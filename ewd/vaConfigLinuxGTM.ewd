<h3>How Ubuntu Linux and GT.M have been configured to support M/DB</h3>

M/BD requires globals that can handle record lengths up to 32k. In order to support this, the kernel shared memory first had to be increased.  
 This has been defined in <i>/etc/sysctl.conf</i> where you'll find the line:<br><br>

<i>kernel.shmmax = 134217728</i><br><br>

You can check that this value has been accepted using:<br><br>

<i>sysctl -a |grep shmmax</i>

<br><br>

Secondly, the globals that are used within the <i>/usr/local/gtm/ewd</i> directory were defined using the GT.M Global Definition Editor (^GDE) 
 as follows:<br><br>

<i>
GTM>d ^GDE<br>
change -segment default -block=32256<br>
change -region default -key=255 -record=32240<br>
exit<br>
mupip create<br>
</i>
